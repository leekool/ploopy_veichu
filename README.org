* ploopy nano mod to use veichu BTUs
i had planned to print a presentable copy of these models and document the veichu BTU mod, but after trialling both 9mm and 7.5mm veichu BTUs i've concluded it's not worth finalising the model

after speaking with people who have made custom trackballs, it seems static bearings are the way to go

i have ordered some of these and when they arrive i will adjust the model to fit them and go from there
